Student Mental Health Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict whether a student is likely to be depressed or not using mental health data. It involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visualizations, data cleaning, and applying machine learning models to make accurate predictions.

📁 Dataset
Source: Kaggle Mental Health Dataset Also uploded those dataset here.

The dataset includes features such as:
Gender, Age, CGPA
Academic Pressure, Sleep Hours, Social Relationships
Depression, Anxiety, Isolation, and more

🔍 **Objectives**
Understand the factors associated with student depression
Clean and preprocess the dataset.
Visualize the data to extract meaningful insights.
Build and compare ML models for prediction.
Evaluate model performance using metrics and AUC-ROC curves.

**📊 EDA & Visualizations**
Visual tools used:

Pair Plot – To analyze feature relationships.
Box Plot – To detect outliers in continuous data.
Bar Graph – For categorical distributions.
Pie Chart – To show depression distribution.
Heatmap – To visualize feature correlations.
AUC-ROC Curve – For model performance evaluation.

**🧠 Machine Learning Models**
Applied three classification models:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest 🌲 (Best performer)
XGBoost ⚡ (Best performer)

✅ Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy
Precision, Recall, F1-Score
AUC-ROC Score

Synthetic data was also used to test the robustness and generalization of the models.

**Tech Stack**
Python 🐍
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn
XGBoost

**Key Results**
Random Forest and XGBoost gave the highest prediction accuracy
Visual patterns revealed links between poor sleep, academic pressure, and depression

**💡 Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how machine learning can help identify early signs of depression in students, contributing toward mental health awareness and timely support.
